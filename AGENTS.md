# PoE2 Synergy Finder — Codex instructions

When the `synergy-finder` MCP server is available, use it for Path of Exile 2 build questions instead of reading large local JSON files.

## Source of truth
- PoB calculations are the numerical validator.
- RePoE is used for mechanical discovery/evidence, not a power score.
- Do not infer that tags prove synergy.
- Do not invent `/100` build scores.
- Tree suggestions are a bounded sample of nearby paths, not a global optimizer.
- `point_budget_verified=false` means the tool did not prove the character has those points available.
- Never claim that a missing PoB metric is zero.

## Token-efficient workflow
1. Call `get_current_build`.
2. Call `get_calcs` with only the metrics needed for the user's goal.
3. For passives, prefer `suggest_tree_paths` with a small limit (4–8).
4. Use `preview_tree_change` before `compare_tree_change` when only path/cost is needed.
5. Use `search_catalog` / `search_synergies` only for the mechanic being investigated.
6. Never request or dump the whole passive tree or raw RePoE corpus into context.

## Recommendation style
State which facts came from PoB calculations versus RePoE mechanical evidence. Prefer a few tested candidates with explicit tradeoffs over broad unvalidated advice.
